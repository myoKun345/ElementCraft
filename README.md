Elemental Experimentation
============
A Technical Mod for Minecraft

Builds: http://mods.austin-jones.info/builds/elex/

This mod will recreate the entire periodic table of elements in Minecraft and allow the player to break down items into their component elements for use in further mixing and compounding to make stronger and more useful materials. This mod, by the nature of how it will denote elements and characteristics, will be easily compatible with the many other technical mods that are available for Minecraft.

Building it yourself
============

You can *try* to build it yourself with the ant script, but you would probably have to extensively change your workspace and/or the build script to fit. I claim **NO RESPONSIBILITY** for any potential errors or quirks that may arise. There really isn't that much of a need for you to build it yourself because the provided [link](http://mods.austin-jones.info/builds/elex/) up above gets them straight from Jenkins. Deobfuscated jars are also available.
